# Schema2Script  

Welcome to the **Schema2Script** project repository for ISTE.422 – Application Development Practices.  
In this project, you will work in teams using the **Scrum methodology** to design and implement an application that converts schema descriptions (e.g., JSON, XML) into SQL scripts for different DBMS platforms (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle). The repository has been pre-configured with structure, milestones, and example issues to help you get started.

## What You Have at Your Disposal in GitLab  

### 1. Repository Structure  
- `src/` – Source code folder (where you will implement your solution).  
- `resources/` – Sample input files (e.g., JSON schemas).  
- `doc/` – Documentation folder.  
- `build.xml` – Ant build file for compiling and running the project.  
- `README.md` – This file.  

### 2. Milestones (Sprints)  
- **Sprint 1 (Due W06C2)** – pre-populated with issues for the *Generic Input Support* user story.  
- **Sprint 2 (Due W09C1)** – created but currently empty (to be populated by you).  
- **Sprint 3 (Due W14C1)** – created but currently empty (to be populated by you).  

### 3. Issue Board  
- Boards are available for **all three sprints**.  
- Sprint 1 board is already populated with issues.  
- Columns: *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Closed*.  
- Move issues from *To Do* into *In Progress* when you start working on them.  
- GitLab will automatically move issues to *Closed* once they are completed and closed. 

### 4. Predefined Issues for Sprint 1  
These issues cover the **Generic Input Support** rubric item:  
- Define schema parser interface.  
- Implement JSON schema parser.  
- Implement dummy XML schema parser.  
- Create factory for schema parsers.  
- Integrate schema parser into MVC.  
- Implement validation and error handling for schema input.  

These issues are provided as **templates** for how to break down work into smaller tasks.  

### 5. Labels  
The following labels are available to classify issues:  
- `Generic Input`  
- `Generic Output`  
- `Generic Model`  
- `MVC`  
- `Factory`  

Use them to tag issues according to the user story they belong to.  

### 6. Next Steps  
- Complete Sprint 1 issues as assigned (Generic Output, Generic Data Model, MVC Pattern, Factory Pattern).  
- For Sprint 2 and Sprint 3, the issues are not yet defined — you will be responsible for creating and detailing them once those milestones are released.
- Follow the Sprint 1 examples: clear title, description, estimate, milestone, and label.

## Getting Started (Optional for Setup)  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. Import the project into your IDE (NetBeans/IntelliJ/Eclipse).  
3. Use `build.xml` to build and run the project with Ant.  
4. Commit changes frequently and push them to GitLab.  
5. Use merge requests to integrate code into the main branch.
